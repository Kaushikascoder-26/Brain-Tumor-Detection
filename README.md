## Introduction

Briefly introduce your Brain Tumor Detection project and provide context for the need of a custom CNN model. Mention the problem you are solving, the significance of detecting brain tumors, and the goals of your project.

## Features

Outline the key features of your custom CNN model. This could include details like:

- Preprocessing techniques applied :-
    Image Data Generator for resizing all the images to similar size to train the model
- Model architecture and layers used :-
    Custom Convolutional Architecture with different layers 
- Performance metrics :-
    in the model we have used Optimiser as Adam and Loss Metrics as Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy
    confusion matrix
- Key functionalities :-
    Random Search 
    Hyperparameter Tuning
    Batch Normalization
    Dropout


## Requirements

    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    tensorflow
    keras
